# Description

"10x_CV_Results" directory contains the results of 10-fold cross-validation. More specifically, it contains .py files, .slurm files, and .txt files of the experiments involving both feature sets (Custom and Partial GeMAPS) and all three classifiers (SVM, MLP, and RNN).

"Best Models" directory contains the files of the best models. More specifically, it contains .py files and .slurm files of the best models created using both feature sets (Custom and Partial GeMAPS) and all three classifiers (SVM, MLP, and RNN).

"Ensemble_Metrics" directory contains the performance measures of the Ensemble model (SVM+MLP+RNN) using the Custom feature set. The directory includes individual saved models (.h5 files and .pkl file) and the .py file, .slurm file, and .txt file of the experiment.
