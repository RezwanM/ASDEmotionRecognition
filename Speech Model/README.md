# Description

"10x_CV_Results" directory contains the results of 10-fold cross-validation. More specifically, it contains files of the experiments involving both feature sets (Custom and Partial GeMAPS) and all three classifiers (SVM, MLP, and RNN).

"Best Models" directory contains the files of the best models. More specifically, it contains files of the best models created using both feature sets (Custom and Partial GeMAPS) and all three classifiers (SVM, MLP, and RNN).

"Ensemble_Performance_Metrics" directory contains the performance measures of the Ensemble model (SVM+MLP+RNN) using the Custom feature set. The directory includes individual saved model files and other files of the experiment.

"Librosa_Results" directory contains all experiment files for the Custom feature set and all three classifiers (SVM, MLP, and RNN). This directory has two sub-directories. The "Confusion_Matrices" sub-directory contains experiment files for plotting the confusion matrices, and the "Results" sub-directory contains experiment files for printing the performance metrics.

"Parselmouth_Results" directory contains all experiment files for the Partial GeMAPS feature set and all three classifiers (SVM, MLP, and RNN). This directory has two sub-directories. The "Confusion_Matrices" sub-directory contains experiment files for plotting the confusion matrices, and the "Results" sub-directory contains experiment files for printing the performance metrics.
