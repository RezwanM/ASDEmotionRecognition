1. Classes: It is like a template/blueprint that groups similar methods or attributes.
2. Methods: Functions
3. Attributes: Variables, methods, etc. Anything that is inside the Class.
4. Objects: Variable that is assigned the value of Class, so that they can be used to call methods/attributes from that Class.

Objects and Classes work together!
